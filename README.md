If youâ€™re looking for an open-core, user-friendly way to publish an app or website, GitHub has a lot to offer. Now, with GitHub Pages, you can get your own site up and running in no time, and you can do it all for free. In this course, instructor Ray Villalobos teaches you how to use the standard features of GitHub to build, modify, and publish content on a simple, static website.

Discover the skills you need to know to make use of GitHub and take advantage of its free features. Start with the basics and get to know the GUI, exploring what it has to offer. Ray covers wikis, repos, and content editing with markdown and GitHub.dey, as well as how to host HTML and static websites with Jekyll and Eleventy. Find out why people are excited about the power of GitHub by joining Ray and learning how to publish your own unique app.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
